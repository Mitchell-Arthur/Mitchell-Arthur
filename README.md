### Hi there 👋, I am Mitchell Arthur

I've been learning how to code since 2017 and was given the chance to work on many types of projects. I am currently working as a desktop developer, trying to transform a system into a better one.

### My current focus

I am trying my best to improve my Kotlin skills. Also, get as much experience in coding as a freelancer.
